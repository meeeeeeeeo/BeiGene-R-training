# 1 Introduction

The layered structure of ggplot2 encourages you to design and construct graphics in a structured manner. It is useful to think about the purpose of each layer before it is added. In general, there are three purposes for a layer: 

*   To display the **data**.  We plot the raw data for many reasons, relying on 
    our skills at pattern detection to spot gross structure, local structure, and 
    outliers.  This layer appears on virtually every graphic. In the earliest 
    stages of data exploration, it is often the only layer.
  
*   To display a statistical **summary** of the data. As we develop and explore 
    models of the data, it is useful to display model predictions in the context 
    of the data. Showing the data helps us improve the model, and showing the 
    model helps reveal subtleties of the data that we might otherwise miss. 
    Summaries are usually drawn on top of the data.

*   To add additional **metadata**: context, annotations, and references. A 
    metadata layer displays background context, annotations that help to give 
    meaning to the raw data, or fixed references that aid comparisons across 
    panels. Metadata can be useful in the background and foreground.               

# 2 Geometric objects

How are these two plots similar? 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align="default", message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Both plots contain the same x variable, the same y variable, and both describe the same data. But the plots are not identical. Each plot uses a different visual object to represent the data. In ggplot2 syntax, we say that they use different __geoms__.

A __geom__ is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data. People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on. Scatterplots break the trend; they use the point geom. As we see above, you can use different geoms to plot the same data. The plot on the left uses the point geom, and the plot on the right uses the smooth geom, a smooth line fitted to the data. 

To change the geom in your plot, change the geom function that you add to `ggplot()`. For instance, to make the plots above, you can use this code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# left
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

# right
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Every geom function in ggplot2 takes a `mapping` argument. However, not every aesthetic works with every geom. You could set the shape of a point, but you couldn't set the "shape" of a line. On the other hand, you _could_ set the linetype of a line. `geom_smooth()` will draw a different line, with a different linetype, for each unique value of the variable that you map to linetype.

```{r out.width = "80%", message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))
```

Here `geom_smooth()` separates the cars into three lines based on their `drv` value, which describes a car's drivetrain. One line describes all of the points with a `4` value, one line describes all of the points with an `f` value, and one line describes all of the points with an `r` value. Here, `4` stands for four-wheel drive, `f` for front-wheel drive, and `r` for rear-wheel drive.

If this sounds strange, we can make it more clear by overlaying the lines on top of the raw data and then coloring everything according to `drv`. 

```{r out.width = "80%", message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = drv))
```

Notice that this plot contains two geoms in the same graph! If this makes you excited, buckle up. We will learn how to place multiple geoms in the same plot very soon.

ggplot2 provides over 40 geoms, and extension packages provide even more (see [https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/){target="_blank"} for a sampling). The best way to get a comprehensive overview is the ggplot2 cheatsheet, which you can find at [https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/){target="_blank"}. To learn more about any single geom, use help: `?geom_smooth`.

Many geoms, like `geom_smooth()`, use a single geometric object to display multiple rows of data. For these geoms, you can set the `group` aesthetic to a categorical variable to draw multiple objects. ggplot2 will draw a separate object for each unique value of the grouping variable. In practice, ggplot2 will automatically group the data for these geoms whenever you map an aesthetic to a discrete variable (as in the `linetype` example). It is convenient to rely on this feature because the group aesthetic by itself does not add a legend or distinguishing features to the geoms.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
              
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))
    
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv),
    show.legend = FALSE
  )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "33%", fig.align = 'default', message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
              
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))
    
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv),
    show.legend = FALSE
  )
```

To display multiple geoms in the same plot, add multiple geom functions to `ggplot()`:

```{r, out.width = "80%", message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

This, however, introduces some duplication in our code. Imagine if you wanted to change the y-axis to display `cty` instead of `hwy`. You'd need to change the variable in two places, and you might forget to update one. You can avoid this type of repetition by passing a set of mappings to `ggplot()`. ggplot2 will treat these mappings as global mappings that apply to each geom in the graph.  In other words, this code will produce the same plot as the previous code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings _for that layer only_. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.

```{r, out.width = "80%", message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

You can use the same idea to specify different `data` for each layer. Here, our smooth line displays just a subset of the `mpg` dataset, the subcompact cars. The local data argument in `geom_smooth()` overrides the global data argument in `ggplot()` for that layer only.

```{r, out.width = "80%", message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"), se = FALSE)
```

# 3 Statistical transformations

Next, let's take a look at a bar chart. Bar charts seem simple, but they are interesting because they reveal something subtle about plots. Consider a basic bar chart, as drawn with `geom_bar()`. The following chart displays the total number of diamonds in the `diamonds` dataset, grouped by `cut`. The `diamonds` dataset comes in ggplot2 and contains information about ~54,000 diamonds, including the `price`, `carat`, `color`, `clarity`, and `cut` of each diamond. The chart shows that more diamonds are available with high quality cuts than with low quality cuts. 

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
diamonds
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

On the x-axis, the chart displays `cut`, a variable from `diamonds`. On the y-axis, it displays count, but count is not a variable in `diamonds`! Where does count come from? Many graphs, like scatterplots, plot the raw values of your dataset. Other graphs, like bar charts, calculate new values to plot:

* bar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data 
  and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.

* smoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from the
  model.

* boxplots compute a robust summary of the distribution and then display a 
  specially formatted box.

The algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a __stat__, short for statistical transformation. The figure below describes how this process works with `geom_bar()`.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/visualization-stat-bar.png")
```

You can learn which stat a geom uses by inspecting the default value for the `stat` argument. For example, `?geom_bar` shows that the default value for `stat` is "count", which means that `geom_bar()` uses `stat_count()`. `stat_count()` is documented on the same page as `geom_bar()`, and if you scroll down you can find a section called "Computed variables". That describes how it computes two new variables: `count` and `prop`.

You can generally use geoms and stats interchangeably. For example, you can recreate the previous plot using `stat_count()` instead of `geom_bar()`:

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

This works because every geom has a default stat; and every stat has a default geom. This means that you can typically use geoms without worrying about the underlying statistical transformation. There are three reasons you might need to use a stat explicitly:

1.  You might want to override the default stat. In the code below, I change 
    the stat of `geom_bar()` from count (the default) to identity. This lets 
    me map the height of the bars to the raw values of a $y$ variable. 
    Unfortunately when people talk about bar charts casually, they might be
    referring to this type of bar chart, where the height of the bar is already
    present in the data, or the previous bar chart where the height of the bar
    is generated by counting rows.
    
    ```{r, out.width = "80%", warning = FALSE}
    demo <- tribble(
      ~cut,         ~freq,
      "Fair",       1610,
      "Good",       4906,
      "Very Good",  12082,
      "Premium",    13791,
      "Ideal",      21551
    )
    
    ggplot(data = demo) +
      geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = freq), stat = "identity")
    ```

1.  You might want to override the default mapping from transformed variables
    to aesthetics. For example, you might want to display a bar chart of
    proportion, rather than count:
    
    ```{r, out.width = "80%"}
    ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
      geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = stat(prop), group = 1))
    ```

    To find the variables computed by the stat, look for the help section
    titled "computed variables".
    
1.  You might want to draw greater attention to the statistical transformation
    in your code. For example, you might use `stat_summary()`, which
    summarises the y values for each unique x value, to draw 
    attention to the summary that you're computing:
    
    ```{r, out.width = "80%"}
    ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
      stat_summary(
        mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
        fun.min = min,
        fun.max = max,
        fun = median
      )
    ```
    
ggplot2 provides over 20 stats for you to use. Each stat is a function, so you can get help in the usual way, e.g. `?stat_bin`. To see a complete list of stats, try the ggplot2 cheatsheet.
